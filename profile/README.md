## What is AppCleaner for Mac?

AppCleaner is a small and efficient application that allows you to thoroughly uninstall unwanted apps. It helps you avoid leaving behind unnecessary files that take up disk space and can clutter your system over time.

When you drag an application into the AppCleaner window, it automatically finds all the files that belong to that application. You can then review these files and delete them all at once, ensuring a complete removal. This process is much more effective than simply moving an app to the Trash, which often leaves behind support files, caches, and preferences.

The software is designed to be incredibly user-friendly and safe. It provides a clear list of files to be deleted, giving you full control and preventing the accidental removal of important system components. AppCleaner is the best choice for anyone who wants to keep their Mac clean, organized, and running smoothly.

Ideal for both novice users and IT professionals, AppCleaner is an essential utility for maintaining your macOS system. It supports all recent versions of macOS and is optimized for both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs.
